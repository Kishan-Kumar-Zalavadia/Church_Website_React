                        <br />
                        Since the early days of the Baptist movement, various denominations have
                        adopted common confessions of faith as the basis for cooperative work
                        among churches. Baptist church Dilshuknagar adopted it as a statement of
                        faith and beliefs in Baptist theology as an evangelical theology. It is based
                        on believers' Church doctrine.
